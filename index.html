          At Ezhire, we believe in connecting employers with the most reliable
          and qualified talent. In other words, we connect real people to real
          work. To help ensure the best matches of said connection, we require

          This process validates your credentials, employment history, and other
          key qualifications, so you can be confidently considered for the roles
          you apply for.
